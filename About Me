<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Marketing Coordinator living in Paris, France. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I really want to help bring ideas to life on the web, especially for the company I was working for. I like the idea of having control over the look and feel of a new website and it's design. </p>
<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a web or graphic designer with either my current company in Paris, Freelance, or Richard Bransonâ€™s marketing team,  because I like to work in a collaborative and creative environment, that takes risks, pioneers and makes unique things!</p>
